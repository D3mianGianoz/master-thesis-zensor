\chapter{Tools for data analysis}
The idea of this chapter is to show the main tools used during my work experience, in particular for performing daily data analysis task, as described in Section~\ref{subsection:script_structure}.
These three tools that I am going to illustrate can be interesting both taken individually, as we will see shortly, and together, as we will discuss in more detail in the next chapter~\ref{chapter:use_cases}, with some practical examples.
If the reader is also interested, he or she is free to investigate further. 

% Chapter introductions perform a similar orientation function in that they introduce the reader to the foci, 
% aims, procedure and argument of each specific chapter, and provide any other necessary reader-information for that chapter.
