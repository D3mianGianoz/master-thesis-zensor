\chapter{Tools for data analysis}
The idea of this chapter is to show the main tools used during my work experience, in particular for performing daily data analysis task, as described in Section~\ref{subsection:script_structure}.
This chapter is divided into three parts, each focusing on a specific pieces of software. Each developer tool covers one or more phases of the data analysis process, as explained in subsection~\ref{subsect:data_analysis_proc}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data processing \& cleaning: Pandas (with Python)
    \item Data storage \& warehouse: InfluxDB
    \item Data visualization \& exploration: Grafana
\end{enumerate}
These three softwares are interesting both taken individually, as we will see shortly, and together, as we will discuss in more detail in the next chapter~\ref{chapter:use_cases}, with some practical examples.
