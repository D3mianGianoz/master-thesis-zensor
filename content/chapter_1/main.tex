\chapter{Introduction}
In this opening chapter, we take a closer look at two major research areas data-analysis and maintenance, and try to highlight where they intersect.
This chapter is divided into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, to set the scene, we will give a definition of data analysis and briefly review the main steps involved in the process.
    \item Second, we will talk about maintenance, how it has changed over time, and what benefits data analysis techniques can bring to the industry.
\end{enumerate}
%Shall we start?
