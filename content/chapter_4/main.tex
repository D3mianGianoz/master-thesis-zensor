Therefore it is logically divided into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A discussion of a use scenario in an industrial environment, aimed at improving the production process and reducing downtime.
    \item A report on an energy monitoring project to reduce overall energy consumption and improve sustainability.
\end{enumerate}

% \textbf{21024}: Finally, I'd like to tell the tale of \cite{Misc:stoffels_en_website}:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item how the demo of this project was launched with an intense daily sprint, followed by a duo collaboration with another inter (Kasia);
%     \item how this project is a bit of a white fly compared to the zensor-standard project;
%     \item  was also an opportunity for me to test my skills in the role of backend rather than analysis.
