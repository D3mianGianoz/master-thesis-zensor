\section{Stack/Pipeline in a nutshell}


% \section{Introduction to Analysis}
% To make dashboards happen, we are using Grafana. 
% One Grafana environment allows for multiple so-called "organizations". 
% Every project, thus, has one "organization" which is visible to the client (usually named after client) 
% and another one (usually named Zensor) that is used for internal purposes.

% \subsection{Loading speed of Grafana dashboards}

% \texttt{And how to keep it fast}

% Loading speed of a Grafana dashboard depends on 5 major things:

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item  pre-selected and saved time window: the larger the time period you query, the longer it takes to open and display the contents'
%     \item  data frequency in the panels - in case of the very high frequency, non aggregated data, even if selected time period is minutes, it will take time to load
%     \item  number of panels with the data inside
%     \item  your database structure
%     \item  whether calculations have to happen inside the panel before the data is displayed
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Operational statistics' dashboards}
% To make sure statistics page loads fast enough:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Take all calculations out of Grafana and only display measurement contents. Zensor Library module is available to calculate statistics on different data streams and different frequencies.
%     \item Along with the point above, make sure \textit{'time'} in the query is set to a dynamic interval and not grouped on, e.g. \textit{'1d'}
%     \item Use 'rows' to group panels together by topic and close the ones that don't have to be displayed immediately on dashboard load (and save it like that).
% \end{itemize}
