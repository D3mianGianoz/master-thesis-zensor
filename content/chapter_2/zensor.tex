It provides not only monitoring devices or data analysis, but offers a full, standardized and standalone end-to-end product that leverages the value contained in a subset of the following aspects:
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item[$\ast$] Operational efficiency.
        \item[$\ast$] Energy efficiency. 
        \item[$\ast$] \acl{PdM}.
        \item[$\ast$] Ageing and degradation.
        \item[$\ast$] Safety.
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\paragraph{Vision} 
Technological advance can only bring real value to society when the user-facing component is driven by Simplicity and Clarity for the end-user. 
Zensor sees this as the fastest and most certain route to a world where man-made structures affect the sustainability of our planet in the least possible way:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] they are intrinsically safe;
    \item[$\blacksquare$] their useful life is optimized to the maximum;
    \item[$\blacksquare$] their impact on environment and society is quantified and communicated.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Mission}
Translate technological innovations in monitoring and analysis into easy-to-understand, tangible and relevant information that we share in the way tailored for either production managers,
management, or maintenance professionals \dots \par
As such, we are the knowledgeable and easy-to-reach companion for owners and operators in making their assets increasingly safe, efficient and sustainable. If up to us, till eternity.
