It provides not only monitoring devices or data analysis, but it offers a full, standardized, and standalone end-to-end product that leverages the value contained in a subset of the following aspects:
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] Operational efficiency.
        \item[$\ast$] Energy efficiency.
        \item[$\ast$] \acl{PdM}.
        \item[$\ast$] Ageing and degradation.
        \item[$\ast$] Safety.

\paragraph{Vision} 
% \todo{EB2DG: eviterei lettere maiuscole in ``Simplicity'' e ``clarity'', a meno che non ci sia un motivo importante}
Technological advance can only bring real value to society when the user-facing component is driven by simplicity and clarity for the end-user. 
Zensor sees this as the fastest and most certain route to a world where man-made structures affect the sustainability of our planet in the least possible way:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] They are intrinsically safe.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] Their useful life is optimized to the maximum.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] Their impact on environment and society is quantified and communicated.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Mission}
% \todo{EB2DG: la frase seguente sembra incompleta. Manca qualcosa del tipo ``The mission of Zensor is...''?}
Zensor's mission is to translate technological innovations in monitoring and analysis into easy-to-understand, tangible and relevant information that we share in the way tailored for either production managers,
management, or maintenance professionals \dots \par
As such, we are the knowledgeable and easy-to-reach companion for owners and operators in making their assets increasingly safe, efficient, and sustainable. If up to us, till eternity.
