    In the numerous areas in which data analysis shines, we focus on \structure{Maintenance}, where the
    priority is ensuring system reliability and safety during life cycles.
    The basic types include: % of maintenance
    \begin{itemize}[<+-|alert@+>]
        \item \textbf{Reinforcement}, where equipment is reinforced and hardened to prevent failure
        \item \textbf{Corrective maintenance}, where equipment is repaired or replaced after wear, malfunction or break down
        \item \textbf{Preventive maintenance}, where equipment is checked and serviced in a planned manner; three subtypes:
              \begin{enumerate} % preventive, predictive, and prescriptive 
                  \item \acl{ppm}: calendar or usage based
                  \item \acl{PdM}: based on historical data
                  \item \acl{cbm}: \textit{maintenance when it is needed}
              \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
