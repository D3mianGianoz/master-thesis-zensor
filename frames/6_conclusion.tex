    There is solution to improve the quality of maintenance: \acl{PdM}.
    It can:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item boost productivity \& increase assets durability 
        \item push industrial companies to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item reduce waste
            \item reuse assets
            \item conserve natural resources
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    % This thesis project aims to challenge conventional ideas about the relationship between computer science and physics via electronics and engineering, seeing them as linked and co-productive processes. 
    Overall this experience has helped in developing a critical mindset, investigating, and questioning the why and the how.

    % this means integrating all the necessary tools and aspects that are often so complex and technologically advanced but having the interface that the customer sees in the simplest way. 
    % You are only going to create an (industrial) revolution if your user (actually) understands what you are doing.
